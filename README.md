# Bixby_Hackathon

This is a Bixby capsule made for Samsung's voice assistant only on Samsung devices. 

For this 1 week hackathon we decided to make a capsule that allows users to take a photo of a "spot" they are at and share it with other Bixby users.
A spot would be defined by us as a cool spot someone might like to visit but it isn't listed on google maps. 
The capsule was meant to build a community of users by uploading spots and other users visiting them and commenting about it.

We have a list of "spot categories" such as Star gazing, Skating, Kite flying, larping, and many more.
A user would either choose to look at the spots of a given category and would be given the image uploaded by the other user, a short description of what the area looks like and a title.

The video below is our presentation to the Bixby team of evangelists and developers who visited 42 and helped us along the way developing Spots.
It walks through adding a spot in the skate category and then us looking at the category to find the spot we added among the other examples.
Sadly at the time Bixby did not allow camera access so instead of an image we used the map as a substitute.
